## Danger Dave Game - Assembly Language Project
Welcome to the Danger Dave Game project! This project aims to recreate the first level of the classic game "Danger Dave" using Assembly language. Danger Dave is a side-scrolling platformer that gained popularity in the early 1990s. This project serves as a nostalgic homage to the game and provides an opportunity to explore low-level programming with Assembly.
